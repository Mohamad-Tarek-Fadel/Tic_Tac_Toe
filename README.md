# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and Tkinter.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: Players can click on a 3x3 grid to make their moves.
- **Win and Tie Detection**: Automatically detects and displays the winner or a tie.
- **Player Turns**: Alternates between Player X and Player O.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. A 3x3 grid will appear as the game board.
3. Players take turns clicking on an empty square to place their symbol (X or O).
4. The game ends when:
   - A player gets three symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
   - The board is full, resulting in a tie.
5. A popup will notify the players of the result.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

3. Ensure you have Python installed (version 3.6 or later).

   ```

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
